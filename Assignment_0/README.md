# 📘 Markov Chain Assignment

This project explores a simple Markov Chain model using Python and NumPy. The goal is to simulate, analyze, and visualize the behavior of a Markov chain with specific transition rules.

## 📚 Overview

A **Markov chain** is a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the current state.

In this assignment, we simulate a system with the following behavior:

- There are `n` states labeled from `0` to `n-1`.
- From state `i` (where i < n-1):
  - 80% chance to move to `i + 1`
  - 20% chance to return to state `0`
- From state `n-1`: it's an **absorbing state** (probability 1 of staying there)
